# css-examples

This repository contains examples of CSS usage.

The "editable-examples" directory contains CSS examples that are intended to be embedded in MDN pages as live editable samples.

The "object-fit-gallery" directory contains a fun image gallery that uses <code>object-fit</code> to display the images more nicely, both in thumbnail and full size view. [Run the example live](http://mdn.github.io/object-fit-gallery/).
